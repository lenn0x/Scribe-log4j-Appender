Scribe log4j Appender
====================================
Much of this work is based on Alex Loddengaard (http://github.com/alexlod/scribe-log4j-appender).

I cleaned up his code to work in non-hadoop environments. I added support to reconnect if it loses a connection or if scribe goes away.

You will need the following libraries for your project, which are in lib/ folder for convenience:

./lib/libthrift-r808609.jar
./lib/log4j-1.2.15.jar
./lib/slf4j-api-1.5.8.jar
./lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.5.8.jar

Example to enable in log4j:

# Add scribe to end of rootLogger:

log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG,stdout,scribe

#
# Add this to your log4j.properties
#
# You can adjust the scribe_host and scribe_port you want messages sent to by setting
# scribe_host and scribe_port
#
# You can also set the hostname if you do not want to rely on Java picking the correct hostname
